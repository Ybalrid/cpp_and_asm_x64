# C++ and ASM x64

**A simpler, better and cross platform way to do this is [here](https://github.com/Ybalrid/cmake-cpp-nasm) using the `NASM` assembler. This repo is archived.**

This repository just illustrate how to mix x86-64 assembly code and C++ in a program.

Currently only works under visual studio.
